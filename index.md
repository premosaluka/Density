## Breast density calculation through quantitive analysis of mammographic images 

Breast density is an important independent breast cancer risk factor.
Breast density reading is not a part of the standard screening examination due to
time considerations. Purpose of this project was to assess predictive power of computer
algorithms for breast density reading using quantitative analysis of mammographic
images. Our initial hypothesis was that raw images have higher predictive power
than processed images due to preserved information of x-ray attenuation in breast
tissue.
